Notes:

We have worked on the player movement more, and added a rule 
which allows the player to move 3 fields per round to any direction.
We have developed the functionality of the computer movements. 
We used srand and rand functions to generate the next fields for
the computer. Now the game can decided the winner by who lands on the 
other character first. For example, if the computer landed in a field
where the player is in that field. The computer wins, and vice versa.
