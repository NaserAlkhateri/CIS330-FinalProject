This week we have managed to finish the game. We have completed all implementations on player vs computer, and added the otion of player vs player. 
We also added an option for the user to save and load of an unfinished round. We also added a bashscript for the user to compile and run the the game.
Since the game can some times be difficult, we added the functionality of a threat detector for each player.
